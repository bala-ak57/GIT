    <p style="color: #0410fc; margin-top: 0;">My name is Yuki Fuminago from Japan. I have 6 people in my family. travelling to other countries each year has become our family custom since I was born. We start to travel overseas when the year I was born. We went to America, Australia, France, and England, China, Korea and Taiwan. My mom especially loves travelling she is always talking about travelling when the time comes close to a vocation. I heard from my mom, my dad use to not like to go travelling but my mom took him every year. He began to like travelling since then.</p>
    <p style="color: #f0fa0e;">Now I have grown up. Our family lives separately. My parents and grandmother are living in Japan where I was born. I have two older brothers who are living in China for studies. and I am living in USA also for studies. But of course we will go to travel this year too. We probably go to Germany in this summer vocation where the place mom wants to go.<br>As for me wherever I am travelling with my family. It is always much fun and meaningful. Since we have loss time together.</p>
